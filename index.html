      <p>Hello! I'm Rey Coronado. I'm originally from Albuquerque, NM but have spent the last 8 years in Los Angeles. After the many sunny beach days and late night music romps, I've come to see LA as a second home.</p>

      <p>My background is in business operations development and I have had the pleasure of working with several startups over the years. From manufacturing to tech, I've seen the rollercoaster that is the startup world. I hope to develop myself as a developer to become more knowledgeable in business and also to develop platforms and applications myself.</p>

      <p>I enjoy camping, snowboarding, cars, music, film, and video games, to name a few interests. Cheers!</p>
